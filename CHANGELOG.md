# 3.1.1 (2021-12-17)
* Fixed Cannot extend from a model object

# 3.1.0 (2019-11-06)
Added 'cellMessage' property for cell view schema


# 3.0.0 (2019-03-25)
* Add field individual field validations to validate


# 2.5.0 (2019-01-22)

`classNames` originally accepted only an object but support a new feature in Bunsen, this also needs to accept strings.

# 2.4.0 (2018-11-14)
* Add `eachKey` to `arrayOptions` view schema. This allows the consumer to pick a better key for the `{{#each key=eachKey}}` used in array containers

# 2.3.0 (2018-11-09)

* Adds `isSection` and `tag` properties to v2 schema. Upcoming bunsen feature will utilize those extra properties to force a cell as a section without requiring a `label` or `collapsible` to be set. `tag` will allow users to defined an id they can use as a reference.


# 2.2.0 (2018-10-24)

* Support `field` in `classNames` hook in UI Schema 2
* Mark heterogenous arrays as list type vs tuple (arrays where conditions evaluate to multiple unique schemas)


# 2.1.1 (2018-08-15)

* Fixed an issue where validation was using the earlier model post value change
* Fixed an issue with `required` only being added to nearest parent object


# 2.1.0 (2018-08-07)

* Support arbitrary form values in conditions. All condition predicates now have a 3rd positional parameter which is the form value.


# 2.0.9 (2018-07-20)

* **Fixed** Travis API key.


# 2.0.8 (2018-06-20)

* Improve performance on conditional view processing


# 2.0.7 (2017-11-29)

* **Fixed** tagged branches to install before trying to build so they don't fail to publish.


# 2.0.6 (2017-11-29)

* **Fixed** Travis config to run build script.


# 2.0.5 (2017-11-03)

Fixing travis builds

# 2.0.4

* **Fixed** an issue in the `CHANGE_VIEW` reducer where it didn't update the model properly when the view contained internal models.


# 2.0.3

* **Fixed** issue with `triggerValidation` nullifying the form values which was due to it triggering an `onChange` with no value changes present. Removed the extra `onChange` as `triggerValidation` was meant only to force a validation on existing values.


# 2.0.2

* **Fixed** duplicate required validation errors for nested forms that send the same `isRequired` error for the same or similar object path. It now favors object paths that are descendants, which mean, the more accurate path.


# 2.0.1

* **Fixed** a bug where clearing a field that was previously undefined had applied defaults with `_.defaults({}, defaultValue)` which would automatically turn it into an object, even if the value wasn't.


# 2.0.0

## Breaking Change

* Altered how tuples are processed. It now aligns more closely to JSON Schema spec for tuples. Instead of using both `itemCell` and `tupleCells`, `tupleCells` is the only way to override the view while `itemCell` is remains as the view for homogenous array items. `itemCell` can be used as the `additionalItems` schema as well. `itemCell` can be an array but is independent of tuples.
* Fixed a performance issue where evaluating a condition on the view or model would override the schemas to introduce additional item schemas to match the current value.


# 1.2.0

* **Added** schema validation for an upcoming built-in renderer
* **Added** a new reducer action type for handling global changes for optimization
* **Fixed** a bug in `immutable-utils` attempting to call `unset` on `undefined`



# 1.1.1
- **Fixed** a bug where File values were being removed from nested form values


# 1.1.0

* **Adds** an extra parameter `mergeDefaults` to `actions.js:validate` that will merge the initial value with the defaults obtained from the model
* **Refactored** the default logic so it reads better and reduces complexity


# 1.0.0

* Making this a major to move this past experimental
* **Reverted** a change made in https://github.com/ciena-blueplanet/bunsen-core/pull/60 around *required* objects/arrays.


# 0.31.0

# 0.30.13

* **Fixed** a bug that cause the view normalization to error out when complex references were used.

# 0.30.3
**Fixed** conditional evaluation of models defined in view cells. 


# 0.30.2

# 0.9.1

### What's new in bunsen views v2?
This schema isn't supported in any implementation of bunsen yet and while the schema itself is much longer, it provides the ability to write much more concise and simpler view definitions.
 * **Removed** the concept of `containers` and replaced it with `cells` that can have a `children` property (an `array` of `cells`).
 * **Replaced** the concept of `rootContainers` with a simple top-level `array` of `cells` to serve as entry-points (tabs if there is more than one)
 * **Added** the `cellDefinitions` property to the top-level of the schema, allowing for re-use of `cells`

 * **Added** schemas for the `options` (formerly `properties`) that can be passed into different  `renderers`

# 0.1.0

 * **Added** validator code from `ember-frost-bunsen`
